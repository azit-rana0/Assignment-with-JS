# UI Styling and Interaction Project

This project demonstrates how to dynamically manipulate and interact with a webpage's user interface (UI) using JavaScript. The goal is to ensure a visually appealing and consistent UI while incorporating interactive features like event handling.

## Features
1 .  Dynamic Stling :
- Font Family : Arial
- Height: 230px
- Width: 300px
- Font Size: 1.2rem (dynamic adjustment during events)
- Color: Blue (changes to yellow on hover)
- Background Color: Yellow (changes to red on hover)
- Border: Red (changes to yellow on hover)
- Border Radius: 10px
- Box Shadow: Adds a subtle 3D effect
- Centered Content: Uses `flexbox` for centering text

2 .  Interactive Behaviors:
  - **Click Event**: Changes the text content of the `div` and logs a message ("Azit") to the console.
  - **Mouse Enter**: Adjusts the background color, font size, and text color while logging "rana" to the console.
  - **Mouse Leave**: Resets the styles back to the default state.
